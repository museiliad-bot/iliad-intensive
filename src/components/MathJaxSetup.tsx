 * only worksheets contain maths, and the macro table is per page (`\KL` differs
 * between worksheets), so the config cannot be hoisted into a shared layout.
 *
 * Order matters and is guaranteed here: MathJax reads `window.MathJax` when its
 * script executes, so the config element is emitted immediately before the
 * loader, in the same component. Splitting them across layout and page would
 * make correctness depend on where Next chose to put each tag.
